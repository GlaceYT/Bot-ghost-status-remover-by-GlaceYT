# About
This is an uncomplete YouTube API wrapper made specifically for ease of use when creating a discord music bot. Why is it more convenient? This module always returns a useful `Video` where all properties are guaranteed, so there is
no real need to make more than one request manually to retrieve something like the duration of the video, also things that aren't really useful for a discord music bot have also been left out such as channel-related information
and playlist information, playlists are still available but rather than returning a playlist object, the playlist retrieval methods will return arrays of videos. All unsuccessful requests will throw easy to understand errors.

THIS PACKAGE USES ASYNC/AWAIT, download the latest node version.

# Install

# Example

const YouTube = require("discord-youtube-api");

const youtube = new YouTube("google api key");

async function testAll() {
	const video1 = await youtube.getVideo("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPBIwQyPWE");
	const video2 = await youtube.getVideoByID("5NPBIwQyPWE");
	const video3 = await youtube.searchVideos("big poppa biggie smalls");
	const videoArray1 = await youtube.getPlaylist("https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxyf3paml4dNMlJURcEOND0StDN1Q4yWz");
	const videoArray2 = await youtube.getPlaylistByID("PLxyf3paml4dNMlJURcEOND0StDN1Q4yWz");

	console.log(video1, video2, video3, videoArray1, videoArray2);
}
